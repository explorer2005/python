module is basicaly the already written content so we don't need tp rewrite the logic, for example if we want to find the harmonic mean then we can directly do it with the help of the module as its already written in it.

python works on repl(read evaluate print and then loop)

triple single quotes semultiple lines print ho sakti haan aur triple double quotes se multiple line comment ho sakti haan

there are 2 types of modules 
external and internal

pyttsx3 is the external module for text to speech 

input is always string in python sp type cast karna padta ha 

string is immutable 

new thing came after python 3.6 is:-
print(f"Good Afternoon {name} ")
here we can use the name variable directly inside the " " 

strings can't be changed they are immutable but it can be done in lists ..

tupples are immutable 

in dictionary difference between dict.get("name") and dic["name"] is that .get give none but the second gives error if the key doesnot exists 
s={} will create empty dictionary 
e=set() will create empty set 
no element can be repeated in set
set are unindexed and unordered

1==1.0 in python because values are same 

in keyword  is used to find whether a particular string is present or not 

for loop with else is also there in python where once the for loop finishes else statements get triggered 
pass keyword is used in python to skip  that particular part of the code 

in file open and close suppose you dont want to everytime write file.close(), so use wwith keyword 

No, in Python, the parent class constructor (__init__ method) is not called automatically when a child class object is created. You must explicitly call it.
